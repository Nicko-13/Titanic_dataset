    "# Titanic problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem definition\n",
    "- Informal: predict passengers who survived and who died;\n",
    "- Formal:\n",
    "    - Task: create a binary classifier algorythm which classify a passenger from Titanic as survivied or not;\n",
    "    - Experience: data on Titanic wreck;\n",
    "    - Performance: accuracy score;\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "- Columns wise assumption:\n",
    "    - Pclass: unequal treatment of different classes of passengers(first class is the top priority);\n",
    "    - Sex and age: women and children were rescued first;\n",
    "    - SibSp: there might be two possible situations: man can help woman to survive, or they decided to die together;\n",
    "    - Parch: the parents can help children to survive;\n",
    "    - Fare: the steerage passengers had the lowest chance to survive (the cheapest tickets).\n",
    "        - First Class (parlor suite) — £870;\n",
    "        - First Class (berth)— £30;\n",
    "        - Second Class — £12;\n",
    "        - Third Class — £3 to £8;\n",
    "    - Cabin: the evacution was from boat deck. The nearer a passenger was to this deck the greater chance to survive;\n",
    "    - Embarked: the English speaking passengerns had more chance to survive. The embarked place may have impact on it. S-England, C-France, Q-Ireland (English language).\n",
    "- The dataset contains information only on passengers;\n",
    "- The dataset contains information only on passengers who were aboard during the accident;\n",
    "- The title of the passenger can matter for survival;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "- Data Selection:\n",
    "    - Pclass, Sex and Age: it is the widely known fact that the different classes of passengers were treated unequally. Also, the women and children were rescued first;\n",
    "    - SibSp and Parch: check if there is a statistically significant difference in survived and not survived groups;\n",
    "    - Ticket and Fare: cannot be used itself, however it might be helpful to identify the missing values of cabins;\n",
    "    - Cabin: see Assumptions section;\n",
    "    - Embarked: the chance to survive depended on language of the passenger. The people who embarked in France might not speak English;\n",
    "- Removing missing values in the following columns:\n",
    "    - Age:\n",
    "        - The passenger is classified as adult if:\n",
    "            - has title Mrs;\n",
    "            - has spouse (has spouse and the same last name);\n",
    "            - has child (has child and the same last name);\n",
    "            - has sibling who is older than 18 (has sibling and the same last name);\n",
    "            - has parent who is older than 50 (has child and the same last name);\n",
    "        - The passenger is classified as a child if:\n",
    "            - has parent who is younger than 50 (has parent and the same last name);\n",
    "            - has sibling who is younger than 18 (has sibling and the same last name);\n",
    "            - is man and share the cabin with women (the same ticket number, third class and differnt last names);\n",
    "        - The passenger is classified as adult in all other cases;\n",
    "    - Cabin: The deck will be exracted from this column. Algorithm: \n",
    "        - Enter the same deck if the ticket number are the same;\n",
    "        - Enter the same deck if passenger have spouse;\n",
    "    Then, the classifier will be implemented in order to predict the deck of the cabin;\n",
    "    - Embarked: will be filled with mode;\n",
    "- Explore relationships between variables:\n",
    "    - Is there statistically significant difference in survival rate between passenger who had siblings/spouses aboard and didn't have; Who had parents/children aboard? Who had specific title?\n",
    "    - Is there statistically significant difference in survial rate between different decks?\n",
    "    - Is there statistically significant difference in survial rate between different ports?\n",
    "    - Is there statistically significant difference in class between different ports;\n",
    "- Features generation:\n",
    "    - Last name, first name, title, spouse ID from Name column;\n",
    "    - Fist class, Third class(dummies) from Pclass;\n",

    "    - Deck with classifier from PClass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare;\n",
